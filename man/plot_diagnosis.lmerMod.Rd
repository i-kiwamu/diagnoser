\arguments{
\item{model}{lmerMod object}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{formula}}{a two-sided linear formula object describing both the
    fixed-effects and random-effects part of the model, with the
    response on the left of a \code{~} operator and the terms, separated
    by \code{+} operators, on the right.  Random-effects terms are
    distinguished by vertical bars (\code{|}) separating expressions
    for design matrices from grouping factors.  Two vertical bars
    (\code{||}) can be used to specify multiple uncorrelated random
    effects for the same grouping variable. %----------
    (Because of the way it is implemented, the \code{||}-syntax \emph{works
       only for design matrices containing numeric (continuous) predictors};
     to fit models with independent categorical effects, see \code{\link[lme4]{dummy}}
     or the \code{lmer_alt} function from the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=afex}{\pkg{afex}} package.)
}
    \item{\code{data}}{an optional data frame containing the variables named in
    \code{formula}.  By default the variables are taken from the
    environment from which \code{lmer} is called. While \code{data} is
    optional, the package authors \emph{strongly} recommend its use,
    especially when later applying methods such as \code{update} and
    \code{drop1} to the fitted model (\emph{such methods are not
    guaranteed to work properly if \code{data} is omitted}). If
    \code{data} is omitted, variables will be taken from the environment
    of \code{formula} (if specified as a formula) or from the parent
    frame (if specified as a character vector).}
    \item{\code{REML}}{logical scalar - Should the estimates be chosen to
    optimize the REML criterion (as opposed to the log-likelihood)?}
    \item{\code{control}}{a list (of correct class, resulting from
    \code{\link[lme4]{lmerControl}()} or \code{\link[lme4]{glmerControl}()}
    respectively) containing control parameters, including the nonlinear
    optimizer to be used and parameters to be passed through to the
    nonlinear optimizer, see the \code{*lmerControl} documentation for
    details.}
    \item{\code{start}}{a named \code{\link{list}} of starting values for the
    parameters in the model.  For \code{lmer} this can be a numeric
    vector or a list with one component named \code{"theta"}.}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{integer scalar.  If \code{> 0} verbose output is
    generated during the optimization of the parameter estimates.  If
    \code{> 1} verbose output is generated during the individual
    penalized iteratively reweighted least squares (PIRLS) steps.}
    \item{\code{subset}}{an optional expression indicating the subset of the rows
    of \code{data} that should be used in the fit. This can be a logical
    vector, or a numeric vector indicating which observation numbers are
    to be included, or a character vector of the row names to be
    included.  All observations are included by default.}
    \item{\code{weights}}{an optional vector of \sQuote{prior weights} to be used
    in the fitting process.  Should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector.
    Prior \code{weights} are \emph{not} normalized or standardized in
    any way.  In particular, the diagonal of the residual covariance
    matrix is the squared residual standard deviation parameter
    \code{\link[lme4]{sigma}} times the vector of inverse \code{weights}.
    Therefore, if the \code{weights} have relatively large magnitudes,
    then in order to compensate, the \code{\link[lme4]{sigma}} parameter will
    also need to have a relatively large magnitude.}
    \item{\code{na.action}}{a function that indicates what should happen when the
    data contain \code{NA}s.  The default action (\code{na.omit},
    inherited from the 'factory fresh' value of
    \code{getOption("na.action")}) strips any observations with any
    missing values in any variables.}
    \item{\code{offset}}{this can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known
    component to be included in the linear predictor during
    fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length
    equal to the number of cases.  One or more \code{\link{offset}}
    terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more
    than one is specified their sum is used.  See
    \code{\link{model.offset}}.}
    \item{\code{contrasts}}{an optional list. See the \code{contrasts.arg} of
    \code{model.matrix.default}.}
    \item{\code{devFunOnly}}{logical - return only the deviance evaluation
    function. Note that because the deviance function operates on
    variables stored in its environment, it may not return
    \emph{exactly} the same values on subsequent calls (but the results
    should always be within machine tolerance).}
